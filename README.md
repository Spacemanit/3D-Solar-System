# 3D Map of the Solar System

## Overview
This project contains the code and data necessary to create a 3D map of the solar system. It is designed to be an educational tool to help visualize the positions and movements of the various celestial bodies within our solar system.

## Features
- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: Users can explore the solar system in three dimensions, zooming in and out and rotating the view to see different angles.
- **Accurate Positioning**: The map uses real data to accurately represent the positions of the planets and other celestial bodies.

## How to Use
To use the 3D map, simply run the `solar system 3d.py` script in a Python environment. Ensure that all dependencies are installed as per the requirements file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Necessary Python libraries: Available on requirements.txt

## Installation
Download all files in a folder, or,
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/Spacemanit1709/3D-map-of-solar-system.git

Install the required libraries using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run `solar system 3d.py`
